## Dataset path and name

Path: the three dataset should be separately located in the parent folder of the main.m function.
Name: the names of the folder containing the dataset are the same as that specified on the website. i.e. parking, kitti00, malaga-urban-dataset-extract-07.


## How to run it

Find the main.m function and do it!


## Software

Matlab R2019b.


## Specifications of running machine

We use MacOS to run the code and it works fine usually. However, when running on the Kitti dataset, it crashed a couple of times.
Specifications of the Machine: 
Processor: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5
Memory: 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3
Graphics: Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB


## Randomness of the result

As we use random method like Ransac and also our method is not very robust, the result varies in each run.
